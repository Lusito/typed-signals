A type-checked [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots) library written in TypeScript, usable from plain JavaScript as well. This is a TypeScript port of this excellent C++11 version:
[Performance of a C++11 Signal System](https://testbit.eu/cpp11-signal-system-performance/).
Of course, some changes have been made to make it work with TypeScript.

The original unit tests and additional ones are running automatically on 

### Why Typed-Signals?

- Arbitrary arguments lists
- Type checking
- Support for priorities
- Add and remove listeners anytime, even during callbacks
- Signals can have return values, which can be collected
- No dependencies
- Automated [unit tests](https://travis-ci.org/Lusito/typed-signals)  with 100% [code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/Lusito/typed-signals)
- Liberal license: [CC0 Public Domain](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
- [Fully documented](https://lusito.github.io/typed-ecstasy/index.html) using TypeDoc

### Installation via NPM

```npm install typed-signals --save```

### Simple usage

```typescript
import { Signal } from "typed-signals";

// Create a new signal, defining the function signature of handlers :
let mySignal = new Signal<(n: number, b: boolean, s: string) => void>();

//Register a handler:
let connection = mySignal.connect((n, b, s)=> console.log(`Called: ${n} ${b} ${s}`));

// Emit a signal:
mySignal.emit(42, true, 'Galactic Gargleblaster');

// Disconnect a handler:
connection.disconnect();
```

### Connections

```typescript
import { Signal, SignalConnections } from "typed-signals";

let mySignal = new Signal<() => void>();

// Disable and re-enable handlers
function handler42() {}
let connection = mySignal.connect(handler42);
connection.enabled = false;
mySignal.emit(); // won't call handler42
connection.enabled = true;
mySignal.emit(); // will call handler42

// Remember multiple connections and disconnect them all at once:
let connections = new SignalConnections();
connections.add(mySignal.connect(()=>{}));
connections.add(mySignal.connect(()=>{}));
connections.add(mySignal.connect(()=>{}));
connections.disconnectAll();

// Or disconnect all handlers of a signal:
mySignal.disconnectAll();
```

### Execution order

```typescript
import { Signal } from "typed-signals";

let mySignal = new Signal<() => void>();

// Handlers are called in the order in which they are added:
mySignal.connect(()=>console.log('first'));
mySignal.connect(()=>console.log('second'));
mySignal.disconnectAll();

// Second parameter to connect is an order value. A higher order value means later execution:
mySignal.connect(()=>console.log('second'), 1);
mySignal.connect(()=>console.log('first'), 0);
```

### Collectors

Collectors can be used to stop processing further handlers depending on the return value of a handler and/or to collect return values of those handlers.

Built-in Collectors:
- `CollectorLast<CB extends Function, RT>`
    - Returns the result of the last signal handler from a signal emission.
- `CollectorUntil0<CB extends Function>`
    - Keep signal emissions going while all handlers return true.
- `CollectorWhile0<CB extends Function>`
    - Keep signal emissions going while all handlers return false.
- `CollectorArray<CB extends Function, RT>`
    - Returns the result of the all signal handlers from a signal emission in an array.

`CB` must be the same function signature as the signal, `RT` must be the return type of the signal. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { Signal, CollectorLast } from "typed-signals";

let mySignal = new Signal<() => string>();
let collector = new CollectorLast<() => string, string>(mySignal);
mySignal.connect(()=> 'Hello World');
mySignal.connect(()=> 'Foo Bar');
collector.emit(); // calls signal.emit();
console.log(collector.getResult()); // 'Foo Bar'
```
